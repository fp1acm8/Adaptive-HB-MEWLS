# Adaptive-HB-MEWLS
MATLAB implementation of Hierarchical B-splines (HB-splines) with adaptive refinement driven by Maximum Entropy Weighted Least Squares (MEWLS).  
The project explores entropy-based weighting strategies for local approximation and adaptive mesh refinement, aiming to improve numerical stability and accuracy in spline-based geometric modeling and numerical analysis.

## Features
- Construction of HB-splines basis with hierarchical refinement
- Weighted Least Squares fitting using Maximum Entropy weights
- Adaptive refinement guided by local error and weight distribution
- Visualization tools for datasets, hierarchical meshes, and fitting results
- Modular structure for future extensions (THB-splines, multi-dimensional fitting, etc.)
